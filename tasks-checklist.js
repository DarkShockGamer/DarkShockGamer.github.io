// Simplified checklist module - Most functionality moved to tasks.html
// This file is now minimal and maintained for backwards compatibility

// Note: Checklist functionality has been moved to the main tasks.html file
// to support the new Checklist + Notes system. This file is kept for
// any legacy dependencies but does not provide active functionality.

console.log('[tasks-checklist.js] Loaded (legacy compatibility mode)');
