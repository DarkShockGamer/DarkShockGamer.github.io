  No backend—everything runs in the browser with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Be consistent:**  
  Match the existing style and structure where possible.
- **Test responsiveness:**  
  Check your changes on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Minimize dependencies:**  
  Use lightweight libraries if necessary, but keep the site fast and simple.
